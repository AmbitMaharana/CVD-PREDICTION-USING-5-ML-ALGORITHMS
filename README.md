# CVD-PREDICTION-USING-5-ML-ALGORITHMS

OVERVIEW

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, making early detection critical. This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using five machine learning algorithms. By analyzing medical data, the system provides an estimate of heart disease risk, aiding both individuals and healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.


FEATURES

Machine Learning Models: 
1. Utilizes:
